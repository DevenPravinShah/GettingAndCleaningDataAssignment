# GettingAndCleaningDataAssignment
This repository is to collect and share Deven's work related to the assignment for Getting and Cleaning Data

It is using this dataset given in the description of the assignment:

https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip

What are the objectives of this assignment?

Create one R script called run_analysis.R that does the following.

1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

I have developed the scripts using R Studio
I installed and loaded "dplyr" package, the script run_analysis.R uses that package.

The comments at the beginning of run_analysis.R has description about where to put run_analysis.R, so it can be run. It uses relative pathnames based on that folder.
